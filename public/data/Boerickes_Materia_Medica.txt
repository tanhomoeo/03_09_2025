Relationship
Complementary: Coffea; Sulph.
Sulphur may be considered a chronic Aconite. Often completes a cure begun with Aconite.
Compare: Bellad; Chamom; Coffea; Ferr phos.
Antidote: Acet ac; Paris.

Dose
Sixth potency for sensory affections; first to third for congestive conditions. Must be repeated frequently in acute diseases. Acon. should not be given simply to control the fever, but for the fever, in which the mental condition is characteristic of the drug. Its range is not limited to the febrile state; neuralgia; rheumatism, etc. Is a valuable "pourpointer" in many diseases; should not be continued after the sweating stage has been reached. Aconite is not indicated in malarial or septic fevers. Aconite is a rapid worker. In cases of doubt between Aconite and Belladonna, if the patient is of a plethoric or lymphatic habit, Belladonna should be preferred. If the patient is of a rigid muscular habit, dark hair and eyes, Aconite should be chosen. (Boenninghausen). Aconite and Opium often follow each other. (Hering). Never give A-c-o-n-i-t-e to a patient who is perspiring freely. (A. L. Monroe, M. D).

Neuralgia of the most violent character, especially in the face. Heat and tingling in the face with enormous swelling. Violent, burning, throbbing pains. Great anxiety. More arterial excitement and more fever than in Aconite nap. Least touch is unbearable. Dyspnœa seems to be due to a cardiac spasm. Chewing motion. Chill spreads from feet to chest. Least motion brings on shortness of breath.

Aconitum Cammarum
(Goat's-bane)
Tingling in different parts. Similar to A. Nap. in its febrile states, but pains and symptoms generally are worse from motion; better from rest. Useful for the stings of insects.
It is better to err in giving Aconite in a case where it is not indicated than to neglect it when it is. E. A. F.
