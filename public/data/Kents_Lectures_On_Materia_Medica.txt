Preface to First Edition
This course of lectures on the Homeopathic Materia Medica was delivered at the Post-Graduate School of Homoeopathics.
Some of them have appeared in the journal of Homoeopathics, but for this work they have been extensively revised.
Owing to the strong appeals of students, though against the author's inclination, the colloquial style has been permitted to stand.
The lectures are presented in the simple form to explain the author's plan of studying each remedy.
The speech of laymen presents all sickness to the physician's mind, hence the Materia Medica must be reduced from technicalities to simple speech. No two remedies are studied exactly alike. Each has its own requirement in order to bring before the mind what is characteristic.
Not all of the Materia Medica has been brought out, but the leading and fully proved remedies such as have strong characteristics have been presented for the purpose of showing how the Materia Medica must be evolved and used.
There are other methods of studying a remedy, but this seems to the author the most natural way of giving to the student a lasting idea of the nature of each remedy. It may be that it seems so because it is the only way the author could ever do it.
The numerous repetitions of characteristic symptoms may subject the work to criticism, but experience has shown that it is the only way of giving the beginner a lasting grasp of the remedy.
Hahnemann's Materia Medica Pura, Hering's Guiding Symptoms, and the Encyclopedia of Pure Materia Medica have been the works that have given the most help in these studies.
They are not offered as being complete digests of the various remedies, but simply as the examinations of some of the most salient points.
A complete digest would be endless. If some of the younger practitioners and students of the Materia Medica shall meet the assistance in this work they have been looking for, it is all that can be expected. There is no royal road to a perfect understanding of the Materia Medica.
It is tedious and drudgery at best, but no more so than any great science. Because of its greatness, many will fail to undertake it even when it is for the saving of life and lessening of suffering, yet many will not decline to offer their services to the people knowing full well and confessing ignorance openly that the methods they offer are inadequate, useless, and often destructive.
Some profess not to believe in this careful way of analyzing the symptomatology, but if some easy method is offered for a pretended mastery of it they wildly embrace it only to return to their primitive repulsive mental aversion crying out "sour grapes."
The Materia Medica can be learned by careful study and by using it. It can be understood but not memorized.
All who would memorize the Materia Medica must ignominiously fail. To be constantly at hand, it must be constantly and correctly used. The continuous study of the Materia Medica by the aid of a full repertory for comparison is the only means of continuing in a good working knowledge.
To learn the Materia Medica, one must master Hahnemann's Organon, after which the symptomatology and. the Organon go "hand in hand." The Organon, the symptomatology, and a full repertory must be the constant reference books, if careful homeopathic prescribing is to be, attained and maintained.
All who wish to make a more extensive examination of the reason for the methods used in the work are referred to the chapter on value of symptoms in the Lectures on Homoeopathic Philosophy.

Preface to Second Edition
These lectures were first published because of the numerous requests from pupils who had listened to them in classroom. Now comes a demand for a second editing which preserves its original colloquial style which was used by the lecturer in the classroom. Many remedies have been added and the whole work has been revised.
Many remedies are in a new and later form of presentation. While the "symptom list" is a most important form in the homoeopathic Materia Medica, yet it is hard to grasp the idea of the remedy from that form when it is listened to by students.
The author has adopted a quasi clinical method of stating and grouping symptoms in a manner to bring out an image of each remedy. This is done in order that pupils may understand a remedy as a whole and in parts rather than tire the memory which is always overworked in a medical college.
The "symptom list” will always remain the best form for a reference text, but it has been observed by long teaching that many pupils who fail to grasp the remedy from the list learn the Materia Medica well in the quasi clinical and colloquial form.
If these lectures shall enable some practitioners to more fully comprehend our polychrests then all that has been hoped for has been gained. It is believed that the human mind is only able to hold a general image of each remedy.
A specific consideration such as is often demanded in the management of a complex group of symptoms either in the office or at the bedside must always demand close repertory examination.

Abrotanum
Introduction: This a very valuable remedy should be more frequently used. It is indicated in such conditions as are cured by Bryonia and Rhus tox., but its symptoms mark out its own individual cases.
Rheumatic conditions with heart irritation; epistaxis; bloody urine; anxiety and trembling, when there has
been a history of diarrhoea. A suddenly checked diarrhoea will be followed by violent cardiac symptoms; it is much like Ledum, Aurum and Kalmia.
Marasmus: In marasmus of children it is a very useful remedy and not unfrequently indicated. The emaciation begins in the lower limbs and gradually spreads upward, so that the face is the last affected; that is the opposite of Lycopodium, Natrum mur. and Psorinum.
Chest: It has cured pleurisy after Bryonia, which seemed indicated, had failed. A woman lying in bed with dyspnoea, anxiety, cold sweat and pain in the heart was surrounded by friends to see her die.
It was learned that she had suffered for many months with a rheumatism in one knee, that she had used crutches to get about the house, and that she had recently been speedily cured (?) by a strong liniment only a few days before this attack. Abrot. restored her to health promptly.
It has caused and cured burning ulcerative pains in the stomach with suspicious vomiting. Metastasis: Metastasis is a marked feature in Abrot. The changing of one so called disease into another
always calls attention to Abrotanum. Inflammation of the parotid (mumps) changing to tests or mammae is generally cured by Carbo v. or Pulsatilla, but Abrot, has cured when these remedies have failed.
Suppression: A suddenly checked diarrhea followed by piles and acute rheumatism, with bleedings, as mentioned above, is further argument in favor of this idea.
The Abrot. patient is sensitive to cold air and cold damp weather. He suffers much from backaches, and his symptoms are worse during the night.
In boys it cures hydrocele.
Acetic Acidum
Introduction: There is either diarrhea or constipation; with the latter he is rheumatic, with the former he is at his best, as when the diarrhea slacks up he is full of suffering.
Generals: The diarrhea is his great relief, like Natrum sulph. and Zincum. Sharp pains here and there, but especially in ovaries and joints.
This remedy is, useful in complaints of pale, sickly people.
Patients who have been weak for many years, who have inherited phthisis, Emaciation, weakness, anaemia, loss of appetite, burning thirst and copious pale urine are a combination calling for Acetic acid.
Sensation of heat with pulsation coining and going, like orgasms; chlorosis in young girls; dropsical conditions in general; bad effects from stings and bites, have been cured by this remedy.
Vinegar is an old remedy for bad effects from chloroform. It is useful in the hemorrhagic constipation. Bleeding from various mucous membranes, nose, stomach, rectum, lungs and from ulcers. Sensitive to cold.
Mind: Confusion of mind does not know her own children; forgets what has recently happened attacks of anguish; constantly borrows trouble thinks something is going to happen; peevishness, complaining.
Fainting spells in weak, anaemic subjects; headaches; face pale and waxy; epistaxis; one cheek pale and the other red; diphtheria in throat or larynx, unquenchable thirst; sensitive stomach; vomiting blood, and all food taken; ulceration of stomach; hot, sour eructations; frothy vomiting; gnawing pain; distension of stomach, with a constant commotion; burning in stomach and abdomen, ameliorated by lying on the stomach.
Abdomen: In the abdomen there is great pain, distension, flatulence or dropsy, sore to touch; diarrhea, thin, bloody or pure blood; profuse bleeding from piles; chronic diarrhea.
Urines: Copious watery urine. It has cured diabetes, with sugar in the urine or without, where there is great thirst, weakness and pallor and loss of flesh.
Genital: Weakness with seminal losses; relaxed genitals and swollen feet. Uterine haemorrhage; copious menses, or watery menstrual flow scanty menses with chlorosis.
Larynx and chest: Weakness of larynx; croup; diphtheria. It has cured many cases of laryngeal diphtheria; hoarseness, with pale mucous membranes; chronic dry, hacking cough in sickly, pale persons, such as have inherited phthisis, with oedema of extremities, diarrhea and dyspnoea, or night sweats; haemorrhage from the lungs; burning in chest and stomach; rattling in chest; chronic bronchitis.
Extremities: Weakness and lameness in extremities, with swelling, rheumatic or oedematous; dropsy of limbs, with diarrhea.
It is a deep-acting, constitutional remedy, and when well studied will be very useful.
All substances abused as food become great remedies, such as vinegar, coffee, common salt, etc. We should look to them oftener than we do for the stubborn chronic cases.
Aconitum Napellus
Introduction: Aconite is a short-acting remedy. Its symptoms do not last long. It is a violent poison in large doses, either destroying life or passing away in its effects quite soon, so that if the patient recovers, the recovery is not delayed. There are no chronic diseases following it.
Like a great storm, it comes and sweeps over and passes away. By a little meditation we will discover what kind of sickness all this is like, and what kind of a patient is most likely to have that short, sudden sickness.
If we think a moment from experience and homoeopathic observation, we will remember that vigorous, plethoric individuals, when they take cold, come down violently, whereas feeble people, sickly people, come down and recover slowly from acute diseases, and do not become so violently and so suddenly sick.
From this, and from examining the sudden effects of Aconite, it will be easy to see that persons who come down with Aconite sicknesses are plethoric individuals.
Strong, robust people, rugged children and infants become sick, not a very slight cold, or from slight exposure, but from more violent exposure. From being exposed with deficient clothing; from (sudden, violent changes; from prolonged exposure to the cold, north, dry wind.
A vigorous person caught out with thin clothing, or remaining out in the cold, dry air of mid-winter, with its sudden, violent changes, comes down even before night with violent symptoms. This is the class of patients, the plethoric and vigorous, who have a strong heart, active brain, vigorous circulation, and come down suddenly from violent exposure, that need Aconite.
Aconite has in its nature none of the results usually following inflammation. The storm is over so quickly that it seems mostly to conform to the earlier condition. In these vigorous patients sudden congestions are likely to be thrown off by good reaction.
The patient seems to be threatened with a sudden and violent death, but recovery is quick. So, as was observed by Dunham, it is a great storm and soon over. Dunham's discussion of this remedy in his Materia Medica is very poetical and well worth reading.
Generals: Attacks come on suddenly from exposure to a dry, cold wind. In plethoric children we have an illustration of that in, the sudden congestion of the brain with intense fever, or with convulsions.
We get illustrations of its suddenness and violence in any organ of the body, the brain, the lungs, the liver, the blood, the kidneys. It is suited to the complaints that come on suddenly from the very cold weather of winter, or from the intensely hot weather of summer.
It has the lung and brain complaints of winter, and the bowel inflammations and stomach disorders of summer. We know how these plethoric individuals become suddenly overheated and become violently sick.
Their sudden attacks are frightful to look upon. All these inflammatory conditions are attended with great excitement of the circulation, violent action of the heart, a tremendous turmoil of the brain, a violent shock. with intense fear.
Mind: The mind symptoms that are nearly always associated with Aconite conditions stand out in bold relief.
The patient feels the violence of his sickness, for he is under great nervous irritation and excitement.
Fear is depicted upon his countenance, and the heart's action is so overwhelming the first thing he thinks of is that he must die; this must mean death, which he fears. It stands out upon his countenance.
He says:
"Doctor, there is no use; I am going to die."
Many times he actually predicts the moment or the hour of his death. If a clock is in the room, he may say that when the hour hand reaches a certain point he will be a corpse.
When we see this intense fear, this awful. anxiety, great restlessness, the violence and the suddenness of these attacks, we have a case, perhaps, that is dying from the poison of Aconite, or one who needs Aconite.
One who has a sickness resembling the poison of Aconite needs the smallest possible dose of Aconite. It is a very short-acting medicine, and that must be remembered.
It hardly matters what part of the body we are considering we will find inflammatory conditions. But regardless of the region or the locality of the inflammation, that which I have described is the appearance of the patient. Such are the symptoms that will stand out, that you will observe first - the appearance of the face, the mind symptoms, the restlessness, the intensity.
Now, there are many little mental symptoms that are of much less importance than this fear, this anxiety, symptoms that will be masked by these marked symptoms that indicate the patient. He has lost all affection for his friends. He does not care what becomes of them, he has not the slightest interest in them. It sometimes may be a state of indifference.
What I have brought out will enable one to readily see that this picture does not belong to all the remedies in the Materia Medica. In fact, it belongs only to Aconite. No matter what remedy you compare this with, you would find it only under Aconite.
You will find some of the features in the text under other remedies, but those which I have mentioned collectively will be found only under Aconite.
Take the mental symptoms, intensity marks every one of them. If it is a delirium, it is an intense delirium, with excitement, with fear, with anxiety.
Patients in delirium, with excitement and fear, will weep, as in great torment.
Great excitement, fear, fear of death. You wonder what she is weeping about. There are all sorts of moods intermingled also with the fear of Aconite.
There is moaning and irritability, anger, throwing things away, all attended. with the violence and anxiety. These features that I described as uppermost are intermingled with all the other symptoms.
"Screams with pain."
The pains are like knives, they are stinging, cutting, stabbing. The intensity of the Aconite suffering is wonderful, so that if the nerves take on neuralgic pains the pains are intense. It is the feeling that some awful thing must be upon him or he could not have such dreadful suffering.
It says in the text, "predicts the day of his death."
This to a great extent is the result of the awfulness that seems to be overwhelming him. And this mental
picture is always present, in pneumonia, in inflammatory conditions of any part of the body, in inflammation of the kidneys, of the liver, of the bowels, etc.
Vertigo: Dizziness prevails throughout all this symptom picture. "Vertigo, turning and whirling."
A woman out shopping runs up suddenly against a dog and becomes violently dizzy, she cannot even get to her carriage.
"Vertigo that comes on from fear, from sudden fear, and the fear of the fright remains." There is a remnant of that fear left, but it will lead you no more strongly towards Opium. "Complaints from fear. Inflammation of the brain from fear, dizziness from fear."
Even congestion of parts as a result of fear. A turmoil in the whole sensorium. Things go round and round.
Head: The headaches can hardly be described, they come with such violence. Tearing burning in the brain, in the scalp, attended with fear, with fever, with anguish; headache from taking cold, from suppressing catarrh in the nose.
Catarrh stops suddenly in plethoric people, from exposure, from riding in the dry, cold wind such as we have in this northern climate in winter.
"Violent headache over the eyes.
Congestion of the brain, with congestive headache, with anxiety, with hot face." Eyes: The symptoms that would lead you to give Aconite for affections of the eye are numerous.
Eyes take on sudden inflammation. Congestion of the eye. Blood red appearance of the eye.
Sudden inflammation of all the tissues; conjunctivitis, etc., from taking cold, from exposure to dry, cold winds.
There is a teaching that has long prevailed: give Aconite for the first stage of an inflammation. It is not good teaching, although it is recommended in all of our books. It does not say for what kind, of a constitution, or how it comes about.
Do not practice that way. Get all the elements for an Aconite case, if possible, or give a better remedy. Another practice has prevailed, viz., giving Aconite for fever. Aconite was the fever remedy of many of our early routinists, but it is a bad practice.
Aconite has an inflammation of the eyes that comes on so suddenly that one wonders how that inflammation came in so short a time.
The eyes take on great swelling without any discharge, or only very watery mucus. The sudden inflammations that come on with thick discharges would never be Aconite.
Fever and Chills: Aconite has no results of inflammation. Those conditions that are about to take on the results of inflammation will always indicate some other remedy. You are not to think of Aconite in fever unless the Aconite patient is present.
With the Aconite fever there will be sensitiveness to light. "Great restlessness with fever." Eyes staring, with pupils contracted, "violent aching and inflammation of the deep structures of the ball."
Give Aconite only when the symptoms agree. An inflammation that is about to run a prolonged course, to take on suppuration, or if it is mucous membrane to take on discharge of pus, will never show you the symptoms of Aconite.
Never give Aconite in blood poisoning, such as we find in scarlet fever, in typhoid fever, etc. We find nothing of the violent symptoms of Aconite in such conditions. The nervous irritation is never present, but the opposite, the stupor, the laziness, the purple skin - whereas Aconite is bright red.
Never give Aconite for any form of zymosis, for it has no zymotic history. There should be no thought of Aconite in the slow coming, continued fever. Aconite has no symptoms like the slow types of continued fevers.
The Aconite fever is generally one short, sharp attack of fever. It is in no way related to an intermittent fever, as it has no such symptoms.
You might find something that would deceive you in one attack of intermittent fever, but the very fact that there was a second one would shut out Aconite. Some remedies have periodically or waves, Aconite has no such a condition.
The most violent attack of fever will subside in a night if Aconite is the remedy. If it is not it is a pity that you made a mistake in giving it, for it will sometimes do mischief. All things that exist in a sickness must be taken into account, not only what the remedy does cover, but what it does not cover.
Aconite has inflammation of the eyes, with burning and sudden swelling; the lids swell so rapidly that they cannot be opened except with great difficulty, and when they are forced open by seizing the margins of the lids with a pair of forceps drops of hot water will fall out, but no pus.
This comes on rapidly from taking cold. Whenever there are inflammations of the mucous surfaces bloody water is apt to flow.
Suddenly the blood vessels become engorged and ooze, the blood vessels rupture and the capillaries ooze. Ears: Inflammation of the ear comes on just as suddenly. "Throbbing, intense, cutting pains in the ear."
The child comes home after being out in the cold north wind, and is not sufficiently clad, and now it screams and puts its hand to the ear. The attack comes on early in the evening, after being out in the daytime.
Fever and anxiety; child must be carried. The suffering is intense. Noise intolerable. Music goes through every limb, so intense is the sense of hearing.
Everywhere in the body will we find that same intense condition of the nerves. Wherever there are complaints they are intense, violent, and the patient is always in a state of anxiety and irritability.
"Stinging, burning, rending, tearing, cutting pains in the ear."
Coryza: Coryza if attended with violent headache, coming on in the night after exposure and taking cold during the day, suddenly, this short acting, very quick-acting remedy will be indicated.
The coryza that comes on from Carbo veg. comes on several days after the exposure. The coryza that comes on from Sulphur also develops several days after the exposure.
The Carbo veg. patient becomes overheated and takes cold by keeping on his overcoat when he comes into your office. In Aconite he goes out in cold air with his light clothing, and comes down, if he is a plethoric individual, before midnight.
But especially is it often indicated in the coryza of the rosy, chubby, plethoric baby. Not in the sickly or pale ones.
These sickly ones will come down later; their vital activities are so reduced that their complaints do not come on sometimes for two, or three days.
So that if you take a sickly one and a vigorous one in the same family and expose them both one will have croup tonight and need Aconite, and the other will have it the next morning and need Hepar.
Face: The symptoms likely to occur with coryza are nosebleed, headache, anxiety and fear. The anxious expression is one of the first things observed in the Aconite sufferer. The Aconite pneumonia will often show itself on the face.
Look at the face; there is great anxiety. It shows much of the proving of Aconite. You know there is much in the expression of the face that will enable one to read all that is going on in the body; it tells the story,
The pleasures and sadness, and the distress of the human family, much of which you can generalize, and see at a glance that some great thing has happened. You have only to guess once or twice before you hit it. Here you have the anxiety.
"One cheek red and the other pale” is in a good many remedies, but the anxious expression, and the fear, and the heat, and the restlessness, and the suddenness with which it comes on in a plethoric individual yesterday it was very dry and windy - and you will at once place this symptom with Aconite.
But it might be one of several other remedies, were other conditions present. "Neuralgic pains in the face, like hot wires running along either side of the face."
The individual rides in the cold, raw wind, and his face was exposed to the cold wind. He becomes numb, then pain sets in, intense pain.
He cries out and shrieks with the knife-like cutting pains. Aconite will relieve.
"Crawling, creeping like ants"; Aconite has that sensation along the course of the nerves. It has a sensation like ice water poured along the course of the nerves.
Sciatica when the sensation is felt down the nerve like ice water. "Creeping, tingling and crawling in the face, with or without pain."
There is intense heat intense fever in the face. The side of the face laid on will often break into a sweat, and if the patient turns over, that side will at once become dry, and the other side will at once break out in a sweat.
Mouth and teeth: Oh, what a comforting remedy it is for toothache.
It has been so useful in toothache that nearly every old lady nowadays knows enough to put a drop of Aconite on a bit of cotton and put it in the old hollow tooth. It will quite often palliate.
A dose of Aconite will act much better. But the violence of the toothache; again the same old story, from the dry, cold winds, plethoric individuals, with hollow teeth, pain intense, cutting, shooting pains in the teeth.
Sometimes these pains are in sound teeth and affect the whole row of teeth. Violent pains from exposure, such as riding in the wind. The pains are relieved and go away speedily after a dose of Aconite.
Disturbances of taste, disordered stomach. Everything tastes bitter, except water; and, oh, how the Aconite patient longs for water. It seems almost impossible for him to get water enough and it agrees well.
Burning is a symptom that runs all through the remedy, you will find it descriptive of all the pains. Burning in the head, burning along the course of nerves, burning in the spine, burning in fever, sometimes burning as if covered with pepper.
Throat, palate and tonsils: Aconite is a very useful medicine in inflammation of the throat, when there is burning, smarting, dryness, great redness of the tonsils, or the fauces, the whole throat.
Sometimes the soft palate is greatly swollen. A high grade of inflammation, acute inflammation of all that can be seen and called throat. But that alone would not indicate Aconite.
It cures that kind of case, it cures inflammation of the throat, but every homoeopathic physician knows that forty or fifty remedies could be selected just as well as Aconite from all that I have said.
I have only mentioned a nondescript case. No homoeopathic physician could prescribe upon that kind of evidence.
But you note the kind of throat - every physician must ask himself the question: "What would make that kind of a throat an Aconite case?" And then the question would come up, could he not prescribe for it as well if he had not seen, the throat?
The throat does not do much towards representing, to an intelligent physician, the patient.
If it was necessary to represent to the mind of the physician the inflamed part itself, how would he treat the liver?
He cannot see it. How would he prescribe for the stomach? He cannot see it. We are then compelled to fall back upon that which represents to the intelligent physician the very nature of the patient himself, and then at once we will see the reason for some of these things.
If you present and Aconite patient well before the mind you can prescribe. It would be well to see anything that is visible. If you could see, the liver, I would say look at it. If you could see the heart, I would say examine it.
What is it in this throat that really represents the patient?
Of course, any soreness of the throat makes it difficult swallow. I mean to infer that there is nothing in the soreness to represent to the physician the Aconite patient. If that individual were a plethoric individual, if he had been riding in a cold, raw wind a good part of the day, and he had wakened in the night with a violent burning, tearing sore throat, and he could not swallow, and the fever came on high, and he had thirst for cold water and he could not get enough of it, he was in an anxious, feverish state, you have then a
patient to prescribe for.
Many times will patients become intelligent enough under your observation to write just what some member of the family acts like. You know just what the patient looks like.
The black man will sometimes give the best kind of a description, better than the Vassar girl, who writes us:
"Doctor, will you please send the medicine have looked into the throat and it is red."
Stomach: With the stomach symptoms what an anxious patient we have! The pains are dreadful.
Burning pains, tearing pains, with anxiety, with restlessness, with fever, coming on from taking cold - not from overeating, but from taking cold, which has settled in the stomach; from exposure to an ice bath, or in
a very hot summer from intense heat, associated with an irritable brain in vigorous children.
Vomiting and retching, tearing, as it were, the very inside out by the awful retching. The vomiting of blood, bright red blood.
This is descriptive of the general stomach trouble. During this febrile state he craves bitter things, wine and beer, and brandy, but they will come up as soon as they reach the stomach.
He craves pungent things, nothing tastes bitter enough.
"If he could only get something bitter." And yet his food tastes bitter, everything he eats tastes bitter, everything except water.
The word in the text is a clinical word; it says "gastric catarrhs."
It is a very sharp, acute inflammation of the stomach. Retching, vomiting, of bile, vomiting of blood. Ineffectual urging to vomit, when there is nothing in the stomach.
With it there will be anxiety, restlessness, fear of death. The fear depicted upon the countenance makes an awful expression.
Aconite is a useful medicine in inflammation of the liver, when it comes suddenly. It is not very useful in repeated attacks, but in the first attack.
Liver: Violent inflammation of the liver, with violent tearing pains and much burning. Then comes the restlessness, the awful tortures of anxiety, moving constantly, fear of death, red face, glassy eyes, great thirst.
"Anxious restlessness” covers nearly all of these things.
Abdomen: In the abdomen there are shooting pains, burning, stinging pains, after exposure to cold, becoming chilled.
We will soon come to think that it does not make much difference where the disorder occurs, we must have the Aconite patient.
We also have inflammatory troubles of all the viscera of the abdomen. It may be a violent catarrhal inflammation. It may be a catarrhal condition of the lower portion of the colon, or a catarrhal condition of the rectum, when we will have a dysentery.
In dysentery, that which is found in the commode is almost pure blood, blood and a little slime. It seems impossible for him to leave the commode.
Vomiting a little blood and passing bloody mucus from the rectum. Always they will predict they will die tonight, or in a few hours. They look as if they realized the sensation of death.
The whole body is in a state of anguish, but the tenesmus and cramp, the urging to stool are simply terrible. It has a watery diarrhea, but that is not a very important symptom, although it is doubly marked in Hering.
But when pure blood is passed, and mucus, with tenesmus, or when a little green mucus is passed by infants with summer troubles, pure blood or grass-green discharges with fever coming on suddenly, in bright, rosy little ones, think of Aconite.
Most of the bowel troubles come on from intense heat, in the children. The infant takes on inflammation of the liver from the heat, and the stool becomes white like milk, of putty consistency. The child becomes yellow and screams with pain.
Urinary organs: It is useful in urinary troubles, bladder and kidney troubles. inflammatory conditions, and with bloody urine.
Scanty urine, suppressed urine, or retained urine. Retention from shock. This retention from shock makes it one of our best remedies for retention in the new-born.
The infant just born into the world has undergone a shock. At your next visit the nurse says,
"The child has not passed urine."
The functions of that little one are not yet established, because of the great shock the little one has gone through.
Inflammation of the bladder, with cutting, tearing pains. Burning pains with burning urine. Urine is hot, dark, colored red; red and clear, or bloody.
Retention from cold, especially in children, with crying and restlessness. With inflammatory conditions of the bladder, either in adults or in infants, there will be all the mental states representing the Aconite patient.
Genital: Aconite cures most violent cases of orchitis, which come on suddenly.
Orchitis from cold, from being chilled, in plethoric men. But in the common orchitis from suppressed gonorrhoeal discharges Aconite is useless.
The woman is a natural Aconite patient, with her sympathetic natural sensitiveness. She usually takes on complaints from nervous shock, from fear, and she naturally takes on complaints from causes other than those from which men take on sickness.
It is very seldom that fear will give a man inflammation, but fear is a common cause of inflammation of the uterus, and of the ovaries, in plethoric, vigorous, excitable women.
Fear will often cause abortion, but when Aconite is given early enough it will check the abortion that comes from fear.
We will have the stitching, burning, tearing pains of Aconite sometimes following fear or sudden emotion. Sometimes a pregnant woman will say,
"Doctor, there is no use your planning for my confinement.
I know I am going to die in that confinement."
If there is any one thing that is a really strong symptom to prescribe on it is that, A dose of Aconite, and then change the subject, she goes away, and in a few days you ask her about that fear and she says, "Oh, never mind that."
Many little things like that can be singled out. But that state of fear is a very peculiar thing, and really represents the whole nature and being of the woman.
She predicts the day of her death. The reason that Aconite is so often the infant's remedy is because the infant is so often made sick from fright.
"Inflammation of the genitals in plethoric women."
Aconite is more frequently indicated in women and children than in men. Sensitive, vigorous, excitable women.
It is indicated in men in inflammatory conditions from becoming chilled in dry, cold air, and it is wonderful how you can convince a patient who needs Aconite what wonderful things there are in Homoeopathy by
showing him how rapidly, with Aconite, you can put him in a sweat and break up a sharp fever when that is a recent and single attack.
"After tedious and difficult parturition. Violent after-pains. Shooting, tearing after-pains, with febrile conditions."
Uterine haemorrhage with bright red blood and fear of death. It is wonderful what Aconite will do in some cases arising from taking cold in the puerperal state, but do not mix that up with puerperal fever.
The first is a simple form, non-septic; perhaps the breast is involved, with soreness in the breast, suppression of the milk and febrile conditions; but if there is suppression of the lochia do not give Aconite.
New-born children, with difficulty of breathing, after the use of forceps, or from a tedious labor; the child is breathless, there is difficulty with the heart, and in a few hours fever comes on. Aconite is a very simple remedy.
The retention of urine in the infant is so commonly an Aconite condition that you will hardly ever need to use any other medicine.
The little one cannot yet talk, it cannot manifest very much, and, to a certain extent, the practitioner is compelled to be somewhat routine in these affairs, and the routine practitioners have been more or less successful with Aconite for the retention of the urine. Again, it is true that in many cases, of retention of the urine in the mother, it will disappear after a dose of Causticum.
Throat: Aconite is a great routine croup remedy, one that is misused; but it is indicated in all those cases of croup which come on suddenly in plethoric children, from exposure to dry, cold wind, having been out in the cold wind with the mother during the day.
The child is put to bed and rouses up from the first sleep, perhaps at 9 or 10 or 1 o'clock, grasps the throat, coughs violently, a croupy, choking cough, with hoarse bark.
Hardly any other remedy can correspond to that rapidity of action, taking cold in the daytime and developing itself so suddenly.
Croup that comes on from exposure today, and does not develop until tomorrow morning or tomorrow evening, may correspond to quite a number of other remedies but especially Hepar, which is slower in its pace.
And it is more suitable in children somewhat run down and subject to frequent attacks of croup.
Spongia is also similar, but it lacks many of the elements more likely to occur in run-down children, those always taking cold.
It would be a difficult matter to distinguish between the appearance of the Aconite and the Spongia croup so far as the croup is concerned, because both have all the anxious appearance found in croup.
The Aconite croup is a violent croup, inflammation of the larynx, and, at the same time, spasms of the larynx, coming on with great rapidity.
The Spongia croup is less inflammatory, the inflammation grows with the spasms; but while Spongia may rouse up at 1 o'clock at night, suffocating and choking, it has not the intense febrile excitement that belongs to Aconite, nor the anguish, although it has all the dryness that is found in Aconite.
Aconite conditions are dry as a usual thing, or there is only a little watery discharge.
Spongia is entirely dry; if there is an inflamed mucous membrane, it is dry. We have in the croup symptoms in Aconite: Larynx sensitive to touch.
"Croup, waking in first sleep, after exposure to dry, cold winds."
Lungs and respiration: Aconite is full of disturbances of respiration, dyspnoea from contraction of the smaller bronchial tubes, which we find resembles asthma.
It is indicated in that dyspnoea that belongs to capillary bronchitis, in that dyspnoea that belongs to cardiac excitement in plethoric persons, from taking cold, becoming exposed or from shock.
Dyspnoea from fear, such as occurs in nervous women, excitable, easily affected, nervous, plethoric women. Breathing short, labored, anxious, quick,
It is an asthmatic dyspnoea and there is usually dryness of the mucous membranes of the small bronchial tubes.
"Sits up straight and can hardly breathe."
Aconite has such a sudden violent cardiac irritation, pulse fluttering, weak, full and bounding; sits up in bed, grasps the throat, wants everything thrown off; before midnight, a hot skin, great thirst, great fear- everything is associated together.
"Anguish with dyspnoea. Sudden attacks of pain in the heart, with dyspnoea." All go together. "Great suffocation.”
From this fear and from anxiety he breaks out in profuse sweat; he is drenched with sweat - and yet he is hot.
When this anxiety passes off he becomes hot. So there is heat and sweat with this awful anxiety. Pulse like a thread.
"Better during expiration." The spasm of the larynx often comes on during inspiration.
"Worse during inspiration.
Constant short, dry cough.
Difficult breathing.
Breathes only with the diaphragm. Chest troubles, such as pneumonia."
Aconite produces a very rapid inflammation of the viscera of the chest, of the pleura, of the lungs, of the mucous membrane lining the air passages. In pneumonia we have this dyspnoea, the suddenness with which it comes on. If it spreads rapidly it may go into pneumonia.
Inflammation runs so high that the mucous membrane oozes blood, cherry red, or the mucus that comes up is white and heavily streaked with bright red blood.
You go to the bedside of broncho-pneumonia and you will find in the pan mucus streaked with bright red blood. Now, take the violence with which that comes on, the restlessness and anxiety of the individual - he predicts the hour of his death - that would be the case with the Aconite patient.
In the case of pneumonia where the lung is involved, it is likely to be the upper half of the left lung when Aconite is indicated.
Sometimes the whole mucous membrane, the visible throat, the larynx, trachea, the bronchial tubes, will all ooze blood, sometimes a mouthful of blood, so violent is the inflammation.
In these chest troubles there is much pain. Shooting, burning, tearing pains, and the patient is compelled to lie in a somewhat elevated position, on the back.
Cannot lie upon either side, but upon the back. Lying on the side increases the pain. The dry cold winds. Sudden shocks, in persons of good, strong, vigorous circulation. The Haemoptysis that is spoken of is not such as occurs in phthisis, but is involuntary; the blood comes up with a slight cough.
Some one might be deceived to give it in such cases in broken down constitutions in sickly patients; but it is not to be administered in such cases, we have much better remedies.
The patient does not always become a pneumonia patient, but inflammation of the small air passages may be all that is present.
"Dry cough, vomiting and retching, intense fever, spitting of blood." No expectoration except a little watery mucus and blood. It occurs a good deal in this way.
Dry cough, sensation of dryness of the whole chest, sensation of dryness in the larynx and throat. Pours down great quantities of cold water, and once in a while after a violent coughing spell he gets up a little blood. But the expectoration is generally mucus.
Pneumonia is generally attended with an expectoration looking like iron rust, as if iron rust had been mixed in with it. Such medicines as Bryonia and Rhus tox, and a few others have that expectoration as a common feature, as natural to the remedies themselves, but Aconite is the cherry - red, bright red expectoration. Its hemorrhages are bright red, and sometimes copious.
All these coughs in pneumonia, in croup, and chest troubles come on suddenly, and if he goes to sleep he will have spasm of the larynx, with dryness of the larynx. He goes to sleep and the larynx becomes dry and he wakes up and grasps his larynx; he thinks he is going to choke.
All these come on from cold winds. Vigorous persons get into a draft and get a chill that will bring on Aconite symptoms.
Aconite has in all inflamed parts a sensation as if hot steam were rushing into the parts, as if warm blood
were rushing into the parts, or "flushes of heat in the parts.” Along nerves, a sensation of heat, or sensation of cold.
The pulse in the highest form of the fever is full and bounding; strong, vigorous pulse. When the attack is first coming on and the awful anxiety and nerve tension are present the pulse is very small, but after the heart's action is well established, then the pulse becomes stronger.
"Tearing pains down the spine.
Painful, stiff neck.
Crawling in the spine like insects".
That is a peculiar feature, this crawling sensation; it comes from cold, from being suddenly chilled. Extremities: "Trembling of the hands" associated with these sudden acute attacks.
"Creeping pains in the fingers" associated with these sudden acute inflammatory attacks.
"Cold as ice. Feet cold as ice.
Hot palms."
Hot hands and cold feet are sometimes present. Rheumatic conditions of the joints. Those that come on as a first attack. Not old rheumatic and gouty attacks, but those that come on as acute rheumatism, those that come on from sudden exposure to cold, from long rides in a dry, cold wind.
They also are attended with fever, with anxious restlessness, with a critical state of mind so often described. "Trembling, tingling, convulsions of the muscles."
But the nerves are full of Aconite symptoms and Aconite sufferings. Aconite is a wonderful remedy for neuritis in plethoric persons.
Numbness along the course of the nerves, from cold, from exposure. Numbness and tingling, along the course of the nerves, especially those that run close to the surface.
"Inflammation of the nerve sheaths. Nervous excitability.
Excessive restlessness.”
Relations: Sulphur has a strong relation to Aconite. It has many Aconite symptoms. In many of the old chronic cases where Sulphur would be used in strong, vigorous constitutions Aconite will be suitable for a sudden attack, and Sulphur for the chronic.
In sudden attacks that Aconite conforms to, that is the whole attack, there may be left in that constitution a tendency to return of a similar attack.
Aconite has no power over that tendency, but Sulphur has. Of course, most of the symptoms must agree but it will seem to you frequently where Aconite has been suitable in the acute disease that Sulphur symptoms will follow, and many times a very violent attack leaves a weakness in the constitution which Aconite has no power to contend with. It has no power to keep off recurrent attacks. It does all that it is capable of doing, and that is the end of it. But it is not so with Sulphur.
After Aconite follow well Arnica and Belladonna. Sometimes it is true it will appear to you that Aconite is capable of coping with all there is in the disease.
But there seems to be a lingering something that holds on, and such medicines as Arn. and Bell., and Ip. and Bry., do have to come in to finish up the attack or sometimes Sulphur. Very commonly Silica. So we have to study the relations of medicines.
If you have administered Aconite in too many doses, or given it too strong, and your patient is slow in recovering from the attack, or your patient has taken Aconite himself unwisely, then Coffea or Nux will often put the patient into a better condition.
